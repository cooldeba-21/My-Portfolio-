# My-Portfolio-
This is my portfolio website.

Hi, Iâ€™m Debashis Mohapatra â€” a second-year undergraduate at NIT Rourkela, pursuing a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering.

Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast with a deep curiosity for innovation. I love to learn, build, and experiment â€” whether itâ€™s through web development, IoT projects, or hands-on work with Arduino, ESP32, and creative design tools like AutoCAD, Fusion 360, and EasyEDA.

I'm an active member of the Cyborg Club, contributing to the Electronics Subsystem, where I get to work on real-world tech challenges with passionate peers.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m a cinephile, an avid traveler, and someone who thrives on being competitive â€” always pushing myself to grow through new experiences.

Letâ€™s build something awesome together. ðŸš€
